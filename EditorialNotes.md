## Test 1: Creating, testing, and running bots in WorkFusion ## 
This article needed general cleanup, some section reorganization for proper flow, and a delineation between the terminology, description, and example components. I also edited it for grammar, capitalization, punctuation, and language simplicity. All lists are styled based on the Googler Developer style guidelines, as the instructions outlined. 
## Test 2: The release notes ##
Release note formats and purposes differ from company to company. Some companies use release notes as a form of supplementary documentation covering new features. Others (my current firm included) keep the release notes more minimalist, only documenting the additional features and linking to separate, newly-created articles to discuss benefits and use cases. For this test, I assumed the notes should include a higher level of explanatory detail about the new features.
- As a stylistic choice, I removed subjective terms like “intuitive workflow.” Although the goal might be to make the process more intuitive, the user may not necessarily find it so. 
- I also deleted the phrase “but not limited to.” At best, this phrase adds unnecessary wording. At worst, it plants a seed in the user’s mind that they are not getting documentation for all features. 
- This may be a *me* thing, but I do not love  the phrase “allows you to.” It is an extra word and an extra syllable. I prefer “lets you.”
- Overall, my principal aim with release notes is to make them simple and easy to scan, so users can quickly find features and fixes without having to navigate through instructional snippets or marketing copy. Those things are also important, but they should exist in a separate place.

Again, I developed my preferences and style by working within my own company’s culture and environment. I am happy to adjust if WorkFusion uses a different approach.
